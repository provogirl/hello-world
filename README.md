# hello-world

Hello people!

I am Eliza and I am an eternal optimist who enjoys tacos, pizza, cooking, baking, and gardening.

My favorite color is yellow. I am married with 3 daughters, a dog, and a cat.

I am 40 years old, althogh that is really weird to see in writing. It is much older than I realize I am!

Learning Python and GitHub like a boss.
